# myStopWord
Stopword extraction for Burmese.

## Project Overview

In this study, we present a comprehensive exploration of stopword extraction techniques tailored for the Burmese language. Utilizing a manually segmented corpus of 212,836 Burmese sentences, we benchmark traditional methods such as term frequency and entropy against our novel proposals, word2vec_frequency and fasttext_frequency. Our findings showcase that these innovative embeddingfrequency approaches not only align with the established behavior of Zipfâ€™s law but also offer promising avenues for enhancing text analysis in Burmese and potentially other under-resourced languages.
